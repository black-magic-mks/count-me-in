### Initial global setup
```
npm install -g karma-cli
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Grunt tasks

To build and test JS files, and start watching for changes to continue doing so, use:

```
grunt dev
```

To start up the server with `nodemon`, which restarts every time you make a change to a file, use:

```
grunt serve
```
